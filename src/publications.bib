  abstract = {We use numerical simulations to study the dynamics of dense assemblies of self-propelled particles in the limit of extremely large, but finite, persistence times. In this limit, the system evolves intermittently between mechanical equilibria where active forces balance interparticle interactions. We develop an efficient numerical strategy allowing us to resolve the statistical properties of elastic and plastic relaxation events caused by activity-driven fluctuations. The system relaxes via a succession of scale-free elastic events and broadly distributed plastic events that both depend on the system size. Correlations between plastic events lead to emergent dynamic facilitation and heterogeneous relaxation dynamics. Our results show that dynamical behaviour in extremely persistent active systems is qualitatively similar to that of sheared amorphous solids, yet with some important differences.},

  abstract = {We explore the emergence of nonequilibrium collective motion in disordered nonthermal active matter when persistent motion and crowding effects compete, using simulations of a two-dimensional model of size polydisperse self-propelled particles. In stark contrast with monodisperse systems, we find that polydispersity stabilizes a homogeneous active liquid at arbitrary large persistence times, characterized by remarkable velocity correlations and irregular turbulent flows. For all persistence values, the active fluid undergoes a nonequilibrium glass transition at large density. This is accompanied by collective motion, whose nature evolves from near-equilibrium spatially heterogeneous dynamics at small persistence, to a qualitatively different intermittent dynamics when persistence is large. This latter regime involves a complex time evolution of the correlated displacement field.},

  abstract = {We analyze collective motion that occurs during rare (large deviation) events in systems of active particles, both numerically and analytically. We discuss the associated dynamical phase transition to collective motion, which occurs when the active work is biased towards larger values, and is associated with alignment of particles’ orientations. A finite biasing field is needed to induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, even in large systems. Particle alignment is computed exactly for a system of two particles. For many-particle systems, we analyze the symmetry breaking by an optimal-control representation of the biased dynamics, and we propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that captures the emergence of polar order in the biased state.},

  abstract = {We study shear-driven jamming of ellipsoidal particles at zero temperature with a focus on the microscopic dynamics. We find that a change from spherical particles to ellipsoids with aspect ratio \(\alpha=1.02\) gives dramatic changes of the microscopic dynamics with much lower translational velocities and a new role for the rotations. Whereas the velocity difference at contacts -- and thereby the dissipation -- in collections of spheres is dominated by the translational velocities and reduced by the rotations, the same quantity is in collections of ellipsoids instead totally dominated by the rotational velocities. By also examining the effect of different aspect ratios we find that the examined quantities show either a peak or a change in slope at \(\alpha\approx1.2\), which thus gives evidence for a crossover between different regions of low and high aspect ratio.},

We focus on the orientational ordering of particles as an asphericity parameter \(\alpha \to 0\) and particles approach spherical. We find that the nematic order parameter \(S_2\) is nonmonotonic in the packing fraction \(\phi\) and that, as \(\alpha \to 0\), \(S_2\) stays finite at jamming and above. The approach to spherical particles thus appears to be singular. We also find that sheared particles continue to rotate above jamming and that particle contacts preferentially lie along the narrowest width of the particles, even as \(\alpha \to 0\).},

Particle displacement correlation functions reveal increasing dynamical heterogeneity with increasing activity. In the phase-separated regime as well as in the truly glassy phase, transverse mean squared displacements as well as shear strain correlations exhibit a regime of long-range behaviour with strain correlations decaying as \(r^{−2}\) on time scales short compared to the rotational diﬀusion time. We attribute the origin of the \(r^{−2}\) decay to elastic interactions that lead to similar behaviour in passive glass formers.}
